"""
Write a Python program that performs the following actions for managing order records:
 1. Allow the user to input the details of ten orders one by one: order_date, number_of-items, total. 
 2. Use the name of each order as a key in the dictionary and store number_of-items, total. as a tuple value. 
 3. Calculate and print the average number_of-items, all the orders in the records. Find the order with the highest total and print its details
